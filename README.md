# Wallet Service

A Spring Boot REST API for managing player wallets — deposits, withdrawals, and balance queries — built with idempotency guarantees and concurrency safety at its core.

## Features

- **Deposit / Withdraw / Balance** — simple REST endpoints for wallet operations
- **Idempotency** — dual-layer protection via Redis (fast path) + database unique constraint (belt-and-suspenders). Duplicate requests return the original response, never a double debit.
- **Concurrency-safe** — `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` pessimistic row-level locks prevent race conditions on concurrent transactions against the same wallet.
- **Optimistic locking** — `@Version` field acts as a second line of defense against lost updates.
- **RFC 9457 Problem Details** — consistent, machine-readable error responses.
- **Database migrations** — Flyway keeps the schema reproducible across environments.
- **Input validation** — Jakarta Bean Validation on all request DTOs.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Java 25+
- Docker (for backing services)
- Maven 3.9+ (or use the included `mvnw` wrapper)

### 1. Clone & Configure

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd wallet
```

The `.env` file is pre-configured with dev defaults:

```bash
# .env (committed with dev-only values — safe for local use)
DB_PASSWORD=wallet_dev_password
```

### 2. Start Backing Services

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts three containers:

| Container | Port | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| `wallet-db-primary` | 5432 | PostgreSQL — writes (withdraw, deposit) |
| `wallet-db-replica` | 5433 | PostgreSQL — reads (balance queries) |
| `wallet-redis` | 6379 | Redis — idempotency keys + balance cache |

Wait for all three to show `(healthy)`:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

Look for `(healthy)` in the STATUS column.

Flyway runs migrations automatically on app startup against the primary. The replica gets its own schema via a separate migration run (in production this would be WAL streaming).

### 3. Build & Run

```bash
export DB_PASSWORD=wallet_dev_password
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Docker Compose reads `.env` automatically; for `spring-boot:run` you need the variable in your shell environment.

The server starts on **http://localhost:8080**.

### 4. Verify

```bash
# Health check (Spring Boot Actuator endpoint)
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health

# Check balance (wallet is created on first deposit)
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/wallet/<player-id>/balance

# Deposit
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/wallet/deposit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Idempotency-Key: $(uuidgen)" \
  -d '{"playerId": "<player-id>", "amount": 100.00}'

# Withdraw
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/wallet/withdraw \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Idempotency-Key: $(uuidgen)" \
  -d '{"playerId": "<player-id>", "amount": 25.00}'
```

(If `uuidgen` is unavailable, substitute any unique string for the idempotency key.)

### 5. Stop

```bash
docker compose down
```

## API Reference

Base URL: `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/wallet`

### POST `/deposit`

Credit funds to a player's wallet. Creates the wallet if it doesn't exist.

**Headers:**
- `X-Idempotency-Key` (required) — unique key to prevent duplicate processing
- `Content-Type: application/json`

**Body:**
```json
{
  "playerId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "amount": 100.00
}
```

**Response** `200 OK`:
```json
{
  "transactionId": "660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001",
  "balanceAfter": 100.00
}
```

### POST `/withdraw`

Debit funds from a player's wallet.

**Headers:** same as deposit

**Body:** same shape as deposit

**Response** `200 OK`: same shape as deposit

**Errors:**
- `409 Conflict` — insufficient funds
- `404 Not Found` — wallet not found for this player

### GET `/{playerId}/balance`

Get the current balance for a player.

**Response** `200 OK`: `100.00`

**Errors:**
- `404 Not Found` — no wallet for this player

## Idempotency Design

The service uses a **two-layer** idempotency strategy:

1. **Redis filter layer** (`IdempotencyFilter`) — intercepts POST requests before they reach the controller. If the `X-Idempotency-Key` is found in Redis, the cached response is returned immediately (sub-millisecond). Uses `SET NX` for atomicity so only the first of two racing requests gets through.

2. **Database layer** — even if Redis is down or evicted, the `transactions.idempotency_key` column has a `UNIQUE` constraint. The key is stored in the same database transaction as the balance update — both succeed or both roll back. A duplicate key causes a constraint violation which the service catches and returns the original result.

Keys expire from Redis after 24 hours but persist in the database indefinitely.
